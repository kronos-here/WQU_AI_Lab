In this particular project we are jumping into a data science competition to help Scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve.
The goal is to take images from a camera traps and classify which animal it is, if any be present at all.

So in essense the target boils down to implementing a neural network model to take an image and classify into multiple categories.

Project Learnings-

1. How to read image files and prepare them for traing and testing on the ML Models.
2. Using PyTorch to manipulate tensors and build a NN Model.
3. Building a CNN that works well with images
4. How to use that model to make predictions on new images.


A special thanks to WQU for providing this opportunity to learn and implement and espacially the mentors Ivan Blanco, Ricky Macharn and Anika Nacey.

I have made sure not to post anything directly but implement on the learnings and build beyond this Lab.
